Greener Lending

Key Features You Could Include
1. **Green Score Engine:**
- LLM scans loan applications, project descriptions, invoices, or certifications.
- Assigns a score based on eco-friendliness (renewable energy, carbon reduction, sustainable materials).

2. **Funding Estimator:**
- Based on the score, show how much funding the applicant could qualify for.
- Higher scores = better loan terms (lower interest, higher limits).

3. **Improvement Suggestions:**
- Highlight weak areas (e.g., “Switching to solar panels could raise your score by 15 points”).
- Provide actionable eco-upgrades.

4. **Recommended Firms/Partners:**
- Suggest lenders, NGOs, or green investment firms most likely to fund the project.
- Could even integrate a marketplace of eco-financiers.

5. **Report Generator:**
- Auto-generate a polished PDF/desktop report summarizing the Green Score, funding potential, and recommendations.
- This becomes the applicant’s “green loan pitch deck.”
